# Pandas
This is a repository for data cleaning and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.

Guided project: This is the project I created along with video tutorials while learning Pandas.

Independent project: This is the project I created on my own from scratch. First, I scraped the source on web and exported it to CSV file. Then, I imported the CSV file and came up with questions I would like to get answers from the dataset. In the example of IPHO 2022 (International Physics Olympiad 2022), I came up with several questions such as "Who were the top 10 contestants?" or "How many awards were won by Country X?" and also provided a few visualizations using Matplotlib.

As a beginner, I still have not yet remembered every syntax. So, I used Bard (AI from Google) to help me with several things. If we know how to use AI for our work, it does not replace our skills but it helps us boost our skills to complete our tasks.
