# Independent projects

These are self initiated projects which I did to practice Pandas and Matplotlib. For IPHO analysis, I scraped the data on my own from the International Physics Olympiad website using the library BeautifulSoup. For Netflix userbase, I got the CSV data from Kaggle. 

For both projects, I came up with the questions myself, which I would like to get answers from the data. These questions are noted as comments in each of the project file. For each project, I demonstrate data cleaning, transformation and analysis through removing irrelevant data, converting data types, filtering, sorting and aggregations. I put in several visualizations using Matplotlib as well.
