# 40 years of IPHO 1982-2022 analysis

In this independent project, after taking a look at the 2022 International Physics Olympiad results for individuals, I got interested to find out if over the past decades, IPHO has been having the same countries winning or similar number of countries participating. Short answer: no. 
I also wanted to see how the trend is for certain countries which are dominating in 2022, such as China, if such countries have been dominating well since a few decades ago. 

More answers on curious questions can be found in my analysis file. I did the analysis using Pandas and everything is on Jupyter Notebook.
