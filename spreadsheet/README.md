# Spreadsheet
Using Google Sheet, I cleaned data and created a dashboard for visualizations. [Link here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qod07-L14vwaZBAhp-sk_ibzMCdmSLZjRFgL8GrL1C8/edit#gid=1348883385).

My cleaning process includes:
1. Removing duplicates.
2. Describing data to be more understandable. In this case, Marital status and Gender are not clearly described (only with alphabets M/S and M/F). I replaced M with Married, S with Single, M for Male and F for female so that people can understand the data better.
3. Adding age brackets to avoid a huge range of age in a chart. In this case <30 years are called Young Adults, <55 years are called Adults and <100 years are called Seniors.

I created pivot tables, charts and slicers to visualize data. These are answering various questions such as: 
1. Who buy more bikes, male or female?
2. What is the average income of male or female who buy or don't buy bikes?
3. Is buying decision based on commute distance?
4. Which age group buys or does not buy bikes the most?
5. Is buying decision influenced by marital status?
