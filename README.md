# Hello!
This is a repository for my portfolio in data analysis. 

My previous experiences in quality assurance and product management have honed me to be an analytical, methodical and organized problem solver. I am now aiming for a Data Analyst role, where I can combine these strengths with my newfound data analysis skills to solve problems and deliver meaningful results.

I completed Google Data Analytics Certificate in 2023 [(credential link)](https://www.credly.com/badges/51e1843b-00a6-4c96-8cd5-46270a3ad2cf/linked_in_profile) and have been learning more as well as creating portfolios since then. I am currently working on polishing my skills in Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau and FuzzyWuzzy. My philosohpy is not to start with modest steps instead of something grand, but do it consistently and with grit.
